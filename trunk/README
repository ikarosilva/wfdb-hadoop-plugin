WFDB Hadoop Plugin

Provides a framework and examples for batch processing of PhysioNet databases 
in a clustered environment using Hadoop.

Configuration values are set in the file:
wfdb-hadoop-configuration.sh

Initial setup of the cluster (including the automatic loading of PhyioNet data )
requires formatting the HDFS system, installing the WFDB Toolbox 
(wfdb-app-toolbox-x.zip), and running the script:
prepare-dataset.sh 



You can test the installation by running a few examples:

1) Run th "wqrs" detector in batch mode on an entire database:
./hadoop-annotate.sh wqrs


After runnign the examples the files will get stored in the /user/username/output 
directory in HDFS. To re-run the examples it is necessary to delete this directory
(or create another one). To delete this directory, run:

$HADOOP_INSTALL/bin/hdfs dfs -rmr  /user/username/output
